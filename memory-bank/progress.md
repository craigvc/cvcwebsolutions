## Current Status Assessment

### Stability Level: **Production Ready**
The core application is functionally complete and appears to be running in production with real client interactions.

### Feature Completeness: **85%**
Most essential features are implemented and working. Missing features are primarily enhancements rather than core functionality.

### Code Quality: **High**
- TypeScript implementation provides type safety
- Component architecture follows React best practices
- Clear separation between public and admin functionality
- Comprehensive API layer with proper route organization

### Integration Status: **Fully Functional**
All major third-party integrations (Google Calendar, Zoom, billing) are implemented and operational.

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt
- Some API endpoints may need error handling improvements
- Database queries could benefit from optimization review
- Testing coverage needs to be established

### Performance Considerations
- Screenshot generation system may need optimization for large portfolios
- Database file size monitoring required for SQLite limitations
- API rate limiting for external service integrations

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Monolithic Approach**: Chosen for simplicity and rapid development
- **SQLite Database**: File-based storage for ease of deployment and backup
- **Component-Based UI**: React components for reusability and maintenance

### Integration Approach
- **Direct API Integration**: Direct service calls rather than middleware layer
- **Server-Side Processing**: Next.js API routes for business logic
- **File-Based Storage**: Local filesystem for screenshots and uploads

### Deployment Strategy
- **Docker Containers**: Standardized deployment across environments
- **Nginx Proxy**: Professional SSL termination and reverse proxy
- **Environment Separation**: Clear distinction between dev/prod configurations
