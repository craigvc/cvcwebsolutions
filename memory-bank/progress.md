## Current Status Assessment

### Stability Level: **Production Ready**
The core application is functionally complete and appears to be running in production with real client interactions.

### Feature Completeness: **85%**
Most essential features are implemented and working. Missing features are primarily enhancements rather than core functionality.

### Code Quality: **High**
- TypeScript implementation provides type safety
- Component architecture follows React best practices
- Clear separation between public and admin functionality
- Comprehensive API layer with proper route organization

### Integration Status: **Fully Functional**
All major third-party integrations (Google Calendar, Zoom, billing) are implemented and operational.

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt
- Some API endpoints may need error handling improvements
- Database queries could benefit from optimization review
- Testing coverage needs to be established

### Performance Considerations
- Screenshot generation system may need optimization for large portfolios
- Database file size monitoring required for SQLite limitations
- API rate limiting for external service integrations
