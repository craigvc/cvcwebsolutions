# Active Context: CVC Web Solutions

## Current Work Focus
**Memory Bank Initialization**: Establishing comprehensive project documentation system to maintain context across development sessions.

## Recent Changes
- **Git Repository**: Initialized with comprehensive `.gitignore` file tailored for Next.js project
- **Memory Bank Structure**: Created foundational documentation files:
  - `projectbrief.md`: Core project requirements and scope
  - `productContext.md`: User experience and business goals
  - `systemPatterns.md`: Architecture and design patterns
  - `techContext.md`: Technology stack and development setup

## Next Steps
1. Complete Memory Bank initialization with `progress.md`
2. Review and validate all Memory Bank files for accuracy
3. Document current project state and known functionality
4. Establish development workflow patterns
5. Identify immediate development priorities

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Repository Management
- Git repository successfully initialized
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` excludes:
  - Node.js dependencies and build artifacts
  - Database files (SQLite)
  - Generated screenshots and uploads
  - SSL certificates and sensitive files
  - IDE/editor temporary files
  - OS-specific files

### Documentation Strategy
- Memory Bank provides persistent context across sessions
- Hierarchical structure ensures comprehensive coverage
- Focus on actionable information and current state tracking

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Project Architecture
- Next.js 13+ with App Router pattern
- TypeScript for type safety
- Component-based React architecture
- SQLite for data persistence
- Docker for containerized deployment

### Development Workflow
- File-based database storage in `data/` directory
- Screenshot management in `public/screenshots/`
- Multi-environment Docker configurations
- Integration-heavy architecture (Google Calendar, Zoom, billing)

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Project Complexity
This is a **production business application** combining:
- Professional marketing website
- Client management system
- Appointment scheduling with external integrations
- Portfolio management with screenshot capture
- Admin dashboard with comprehensive functionality

### Technical Maturity
The project shows evidence of:
- Established API integration patterns
- Comprehensive Docker deployment setup
- Multiple environment configurations
- Database-driven content management
- Professional security considerations (SSL, protected routes)

### Current State Assessment
Based on file structure analysis:
- **Frontend**: Complete Next.js application with routing
- **Backend**: Extensive API route implementation
- **Database**: SQLite integration with content management
- **Integrations**: Google Calendar, Zoom, billing systems
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Nginx, SSL certificate management
- **Admin System**: Comprehensive dashboard functionality

## Key Context for Future Sessions
- This is a **production system** serving real business needs
- Changes must consider existing integrations and client impact
- Security and reliability are paramount
- Memory Bank must be consulted at start of every session
- Documentation updates required after significant changes
